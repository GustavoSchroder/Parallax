Cmomo seria para fazer um parallax? 

void UpdateBackground(Background &back)
{
    back.x += back.velX * back.dirX;
    if(back.x + back.width <= 0)
        back.x = 0;
}
void DrawBackground(Background &back)
{
    draw_bitmap(back.image, back.x, back.y, 0);

    if(back.x + back.width < WIDTH)
        draw_bitmap(back.image, back.x + back.width, back.y, 0);
}
So this draws a parallax effect w

____________________

Parallax backgrounds are divorced from reality, you don't need velocities and directions. What you do need is to base the background's X on the camera's position and modified with multiplier to offset the background more slowly so it looks like it is very far away. Different layers of background can look closer by making this magic number bigger, so instead of 0.1f for far away use 0.3f for up close, etc...

An example might look like:

void UpdateBackground(Background &back, float cameraX)
{
    back.x = cameraX * 0.1f; // magic number to make the background move slowly
    back.x = fmod( back.x, back.width );
}

You want to create a couple of variables representing the camera position - cameraX and cameraY. You then want to set these to equal the position of your character, possibly adding on a bit extra in the direction of movement.

To position the main layer, it's just:

mainLayer.x = -cameraX;

for the middle layer, something like:

middleLayer.x = -cameraX * 0.5;

for the far layer:

farLayer.x = -cameraX * 0.2;
